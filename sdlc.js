// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Implementation
// Design
// Maintain
// Analysis of Requirements
// Testing & Integration
// Planning

/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a 
    definition of the step. The first one is done for you.

const design = "This is the third step, where requirements are looked over and best ideas of solutions "+
"of how to create the software are made and clearly defined."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step,where the requirements are analyzed and split into smaller chunks of tasks that can be done in routine to get to the"+
"end result. Developers are to follow coding guidlines when producing the software."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step step, where the software is tested for bugs and notable issues. These issues or bugs are"+
 "reported, tracked, fixed, and retested. QA's would run through user test cases."
